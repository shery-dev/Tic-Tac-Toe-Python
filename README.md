# Tic-Tac-Toe-Python
A fun and interactive **Tic Tac Toe** game built in Python 🐍 with a graphical interface. Unlike simple console versions, this project provides a **visual game board** where players can click to place their moves (X and O). It’s a great beginner-friendly project demonstrating game logic, GUI programming, and clean code structure.
